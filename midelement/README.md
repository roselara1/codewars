Problem Domain:
Write a function named isNice/IsNice that returns "true" if an aray argument is nice, else, "false". It should also return "false" if the input array has no elements. Nice means for every value "n" in the array, there is also an element "n-1" or "n+1" in the array.

Code Given:
function isNice{
    //code here
    return nice

Credit: Chi helped us out as we could not get our function to solve more than half of the code by teaching us arr.includes.
