Code Provided:
function double(array) {
    // Use array.map() to return a new array with each value twice
    // as large as the corresponding value in the passed in array.
}


My Solution: I had to look up array.map using the MDN documents to see if I could use it on its own in an arrow function. Once I realized I could, I worked out an arrow function and had the array represented by "i" and multiplied i by 2.
