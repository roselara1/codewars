Code Provided:
function double(array) {
    // Use array.map() to return a new array with each value twice
    // as large as the corresponding value in the passed in array.
}


My Solution: We attempted to solve the code by not using .reverse as a challenge. Tara came up with the idea of using two arrays and splitting the first one and then joining them.
