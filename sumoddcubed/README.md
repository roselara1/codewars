Code Given:
function cubeOdd(arr) {

Credit: I used MDN docs to learn about how to find an odd number. Then I referenced some of my old regexes to see how I removed the strings before but we ended up scrapping those. Suzanne used repl.it to check the function and try to make it return 0 for one of the problems. Then an if else was addded to return 0 for instances when the sum was 0.
