Challenge Link: https://www.codewars.com/kata/calculate-average/

Code Provided:
function find_average(array) {
    //retunr 0;
}


My Solution: First I tried to use a variable, and then changed it to let as I remembered that let is the new standard. Then I worked using the same method that I used in a previous Kata, to make the function an arrow function. I used array.reduce after reading about it in Stack Overflow and divided by the array lenght to get the result.
